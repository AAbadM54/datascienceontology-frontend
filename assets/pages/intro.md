In this introductory guide, we explain the two basic entities comprising the Data Science Ontology, *concepts* and *annotations*. We also explain the ontology language by which concepts and annotations are specified, including both its textual syntax and graphical syntax. After completing this guide, you should be able to interpret the concept and annotation entries found on this website, as well as the semantic representations of data analyses produced by the Open Discovery project. The intended audience is working data scientists, authors of statistical software, and other practitioners of data-driven science.
