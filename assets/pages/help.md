The Data Science Ontology is an ontology (knowledge base) about data science with a focus on computer programming for data analysis. The concepts of the ontology are drawn from statistics, machine learning, and the engineering practice of data science. Besides cataloging and organizing data science concepts, the ontology provides semantic annotations of commonly used software libraries for data science, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). The annotations map the libraries' types and functions onto the ontology's universal concepts. In conjunction with program analysis tools, the annotations can be used to construct semantic representations of data analyses.
