# Frontend for Data Science Ontology

This repository contains the web frontend for the Data Science Ontology, written
in TypeScript and React.

The Data Science Ontology itself lives in its own
[repository](https://github.com/ibm/datascienceontology).

## Getting started

To serve the frontend locally, install the dependencies using `yarn` and then
run `npm run serve`. The development server will proxy the official
[backend](https://github.com/epatters/datascienceontology-backend) running at
https://api.datascienceontology.org.
